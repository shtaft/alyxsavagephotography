My name is Alyx Savage, and I'm a passionate photographer based in Victoria, BC. I specialize in capturing unique and beautiful moments through the lens of my camera.

I have been shooting professionally for several years, and I have become well-known in the local Victoria photography community. I'm passionate about creating stunning images that capture the beauty and emotion of the moment. Whether it's a portrait, landscape, or abstract shot, I strive to bring out the best in my subjects.

My goal is to create timeless images that will last for generations to come. I believe that everyone has a story to tell, and I strive to capture that story in the most creative way possible.

I hope you enjoy my work and thank you for visiting my website.
